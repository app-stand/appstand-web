# What is AppStand?

**AppStand** <sub><sup>(German: **_[ËˆapËŒÊƒtant]_**)</sup></sub> is a one-man coding project based in Zurich, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.

Since 2017 I have been coding apps and websites - just for fun and to learn new skills that I can use at my work. Even though these were always just small side-projects for me, some apps are actually being used quite frequently and by a bunch of users now.

So who knows - maybe there is more to come. In any case - go check out my apps and feel free to contact me via the [contact form](/contact).
